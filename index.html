        Shall we remove the rotating cooking shift? Currently, each of the 6 people in the house is assigned a cooking day, with one extra day as a        rotating shift. Since everyone is busy with work, we propose removing the rotating shift. On that day, each person would prepare their own food and clean their own dishes.
